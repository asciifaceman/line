# Line

Line is a simple CLI utility for reading individual and ranges of lines from
a given file

# Usage

```
line [-l n -l n-N] filename
```

The primary functionality of line is surfaced via the `-l` flag which defines 
either a singleton of range of lines (such as 5-7). This flag can be repeated
to gather various singletons or ranges. If EOF is reached in the middle of a range line will WARN but return what it gathered, if EOF is reached before a requested line or range is reached it will error out.

```
$ line -l 2 -l 9-11 main.go
